## :book: Overview

Welcome to my home Kubernetes cluster.

Lots of fun (to me at least :wink:) stuff can be found, poke around my [apps](./cluster/apps/) directory to see what my cluster is running. Feel free to open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/gperezmz/home-ops/issues/new).

## :robot:&nbsp; Automation

- [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) with the help of the [k8s-at-home/renovate-helm-releases](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/renovate-helm-releases) Github action keeps my application charts and container images up-to-date

## :handshake:&nbsp; Thanks

A lot of inspiration for this repo came from the people that have shared their clusters over at [awesome-home-kubernetes](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/awesome-home-kubernetes)
